title: First Post!
---

In the life of a blog, you only get a one shot at creating a 'first post'. It can set the tone for future posts (good or bad) or can simply be an introduction. And still another possibility it is an anchor; a marker which can serve as a reminder of where you were at a given point in time.

Reflecting on it, it's tempting to over-think a first post where it never is quite finished or worse, never published. Because if you don't start *somewhere* then you have nowhere to look back upon.

Something said in a recent meeting really resonated with me. It was related to change culture in an organization and went something like this:
> "You can think about and try to come up with the _right_ way to change culture, but at some point, you just need to do __something__, even small things. Because at the end of the day, doing something vs. thinking about it is more effective than waiting to come up with the larger plan..."

I found this thought quite liberating; it's a reminder that often times is more important to do __something__ then only thinking about it. It's okay to do something, even if it turns out to be the wrong __something__. It's the act of doing where you learn and actually make a difference.

Keeping this in mind is important; go out a do __something__!
